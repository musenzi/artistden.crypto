Ibi Village 

Ibi Village also has a dispensary providing medical help to Ibi but also to all the villages around it.

This has been mainly financed by the group I joined AIV and is one of the projects we want to see succeed the most!

In times of corona this is a hot topic ofc but we are in it for the long run...
