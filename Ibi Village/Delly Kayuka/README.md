Delly Kayuka

Delly Kayuka was a great man and helped the village like no other.
He pushed the boundaries of planting and creating value for this project.

Unfortunately he died some time ago and when I joined the group of AIV I inherited his gmail account. I did not know at the time but I archived everything to be able to give it to his family sometime...

So he's a project of his own, he's a league of his own.

Wherever you are Delly, Thank you!
