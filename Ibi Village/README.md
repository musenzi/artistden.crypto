Ibi Village 

Is a village in Congo where a lot of groups are active to make a great community of awesome people.

This project has 20 years of maturity! 
Almost as old as I am...

I'm just glad I can help out

We are currently revamping the site (Might include Zilon ^^ )

Keep posted for more to come...
