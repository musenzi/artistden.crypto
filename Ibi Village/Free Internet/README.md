Ok this one is a little crazy idea I had while developping Scilla contracts.

In RDC the prices of internet or steep!

I asked around and couldn't find a thing les than 1$/1Gb

You may think it's ok but when u use one modem to provide internet to a whole community your Gigabytes fly out the window.

Worst part is, I can't find an unlimited plan.

YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR EVERY GIGABYTE!!!!
