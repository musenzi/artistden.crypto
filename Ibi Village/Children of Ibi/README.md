School of Ibi 

The school of Ibi is another project realized by AIV way before my time.

The school now gives free aducation to about 140 children coming from multiple villages...

Our main goals here are:

1. Providing a transport for children to go to school (Schoolbus, carpool, bikes, ...)
2. Help the wonderful teachers improve their skills
3. Shipping educative material (this is difficult, ZIL is borderless a whiteboard isn't...)
